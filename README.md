# Tetris-game
This project is a classic implementation of the Tetris game, developed entirely in Java. The game features traditional Tetris mechanics where players must rotate and place falling blocks to complete and clear lines. The objective is to prevent the blocks from stacking up to the top of the screen for as long as possible. Enjoy the nostalgia of this timeless puzzle game with our modern, Java-based version.
